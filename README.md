# Project's Title
   Automated tests for authorization and registration 
# Project Description
   This project helps to automate www.postalon.com web page tests.
# How to Install and Run the Project.
   To run automated tests, I wrote various dependencies in the pom.xml file, e.g selenium web driver, and also used build tools like allure-TestNG, TestNG, maven, and web driver manager.
   Several steps are needed:
        1. download source code.
        2. Use maven as build tool.
        3. Hit run application icon
# Reports
   To see the executed report, which test was successful or which test failed, we can see it in the Alluriereport, which is generated after running all the tests.
